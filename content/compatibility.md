Compatibility
=============

You should have .NET Framework 4.6 installed on the target machine. The server should be compatible with the following configurations.

* Microsoft Windows 7 & IIS 7+
* Microsoft Windows 8 & IIS 7+
* Microsoft Windows 2008 Server & IIS 7+
* Microsoft Windows 2012 & IIS 7+
* Microsoft Windows 10 & IIS 8+

User interface should work in any modern browser.  We don't test in archaic browsers.
